## Sales Analysis Project

This is yet another project as part of my practice for data analysis using Python. 
<br>
The source for this particular project is ***Keith Galli***, a YouTuber, who posts and shares a whole lot of stuff related to data science.
<br>
This was one of his projects which I decided to attempt on my own copying as minimal code and approach as possible from the actual video.
<br><br>
I only attempted the questions that Keith had already mentioned in his video but the approach to data cleaning and the actual solutions for the questions and visual representations was totally genuine, picking up some but not all key inferences and approaches from the video that seemed insightful.
<br><br>
The final notebook file in the repository named ['Sales_Analysis.ipynb'](Sales_Analysis.ipynb) is the finished, although not perfect but genuine, output for the data.
